# EasyBook — Demo Airline Booking UI

This is a small static demo of an airline booking UI called EasyBook.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main UI
- `styles.css` — styles
- `app.js` — client-side booking simulation

How to run

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click), or run a local static server:

```bash
cd /Users/ruddra1518/Desktop/cicd
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes
- This is a front-end demo. Bookings are stored in `localStorage` only.
- If you want, I can add a small backend or persist bookings to a server.
